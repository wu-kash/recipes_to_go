Instructions:

    - In a large pot of boiling water, cook ravioli just until tender, about 2-3 minutes.
    - Combine marinara sauce and cream cheese in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until cream cheese has melted, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in thyme and parsley.
    - Spread ravioli into the prepared baking dish. Top with marinara mixture and sprinkle with mozzarella. Place into oven and bake until cheese has melted, about 20 minutes.
    - Serve immediately, garnished with Parmesan and basil.
