Preparation:
    - Thinly slice the onion and the celery.
Cooking:
    - Stir together shallot and vinegar in a small bowl; set aside. Place potatoes and 2 teaspoons of the salt in a large saucepan. Cover with 10 cups water; bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium. Cook, undisturbed, until potatoes are fork-tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain; transfer to a large bowl.
    - Using a slotted spoon, remove shallot from vinegar, and transfer to large bowl with potatoes. Reserve vinegar in small bowl. Add lemon juice, Dijon mustard, pepper, and remaining \sfrac{1}{2} teaspoon salt to vinegar, whisk together until combined. Gradually whisk in oil until combined.
    - Add lemon-vinegar mixture, celery, and fennel to potato mixture. Toss to coat, using back of a spoon to gently smash about one-third of potatoes. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve (up to 12 hours). Garnish with additional fennel leaves before serving.
