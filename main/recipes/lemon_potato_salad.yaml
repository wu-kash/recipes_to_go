Preparations:
    - Thinly slice the onion and the celery.
Instructions:
    - Stir together onion and vinegar in a small bowl and set aside. Place potatoes and 2 teaspoons of the salt in a large saucepan. Cover with 10 cups water, bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until potatoes are fork-tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
    - Remove onion from vinegar, and transfer to large bowl with potatoes. Reserve vinegar in small bowl. Add lemon juice, Dijon mustard, pepper, and remaining sfrac{1}{2} teaspoon salt to vinegar, whisk together until combined. Gradually whisk in oil until combined.
    - Add lemon-vinegar mixture, celery, and fennel to potato mixture. Toss to coat, using back of a spoon to gently smash about one-third of potatoes. Serve immediately, or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. Garnish with additional fennel leaves before serving.
